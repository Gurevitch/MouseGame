When fixed, move to the **Resolved** section with the date.

## Open Issues

### Story / Flow

- [ ] `[P1]` Postcard not added to inventory after Curator dialog (item pickup missing)
- [ ] `[P1]` No Marcus healing flow — giving postcard to Marcus should cure him
- [ ] `[P2]` Higgins bedtime dialog uses existing entrance sprite — needs new camp sprite (see STATUS.md assets)
- [ ] `[P2]` Airplane cutscene uses PP standing idle — needs sitting-in-plane sprite

### Scenes / Navigation

- [ ] `[P2]` Kid rooms (Tommy, Jake, Lily, Danny) have no NPCs inside — should have kids in their rooms on Day 2

### Travel Map

- [ ] `[P2]` Buenos Aires and Rio pins are close together — landmarks may overlap visually

### Assets

- [ ] `[P1]` Need Higgins camp sprite (idle + talk) for bedtime scene
- [ ] `[P1]` Need PP airplane idle sprite for flight cutscene
- [ ] `[P2]` No airplane background — currently using paris_clouds.png as fallback

## Resolved

| Issue | Date | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Map used dots instead of landmarks | 2026-04-08 | Replaced with landmark images from ui/landmarks/ |
| Night scene too simple (instant Marcus room) | 2026-04-08 | Reworked to multi-phase: campfire sleep → Marcus freakout → wakeup |
| No airplane transition before cities | 2026-04-08 | Added airplane_flight scene with 4-second cutscene |

*When adding issues, check STORY.md to verify expected behavior.*

### Reported (2026-04-08)

- [x] `[P1]` PP sleeping sprite showed in Marcus room + freakout dialog didn't auto-start — FIXED: sleeping sprite hidden during Marcus phase, dialog trigger fixed with flag
- [x] `[P2]` No Higgins visible on camp_grounds during bedtime — FIXED: Higgins NPC now spawns on camp_grounds for bedtime dialog, removed after
- [ ] `[P3]` Camp night background looks too big/zoomed — this is an asset issue (the camp_night.png image itself). Regenerate the image at correct proportions or crop it

### Reported-plan mod
- [x] `[P1]` NPC sprite grid formats were wrong (code loaded as 15x1, actual sprites vary) — FIXED: updated all NPC loading to use correct cols x rows per sprite. Added `loadNPCGrid` function.
- [x] `[P2]` Cabin arrows sent PP walking off-screen — FIXED: changed cabin hotspots from `arrowUp` to `arrowNone`, moved bounds to door area (Y:340-430). PP now walks to cabin door then transitions.
- [x] `[P3]` Danny overlapped with Higgins office arrow — FIXED: moved Danny NPC bounds left (X:1170 → X:1120) for more clearance.
- [ ] `[P4]` Airplane full idle: need sprite of small airplane with PP head visible in window, 1x10 strip, plane bobs up/down and propeller spins
- [ ] `[P5]` Background removal losing colors — magenta chroma key didn't work with AI tool

### Reported-plan mod (batch 2)
- [x] `[P1]` Can't reach Higgins office on Day 2 — FIXED: extended walk path to X:1400
- [x] `[P1]` Marcus room triggers night scene early — FIXED: added `metKids >= 5` guard to night trigger
- [x] `[P1]` NPC sprites multi-row — already fixed (loadNPCGrid supports any cols x rows)
- [x] `[P1]` Gray/black background around NPCs — FIXED: switched to SpriteGridFromPNG (auto color-key removal)
- [x] `[P1]` Rearrange NPC files to folders — DONE: `npc/higgins/`, `npc/kids/{marcus,tommy,jake,lily,danny}/`

### Reported
- [ ] `[P0]` write in plan mode!
- [ ] `[P0]` check what we can improve in our game, regarding dynamic and movement. check until reaching to paris.also check if we can use a better technology for our game
- [ ] `[P1]` we need to change every object to be with white background. some of the picture are 4 frames in two line. so i want one same format for everyone.
             now you will give me a spesific promt for everny npc include the pp. that will be 8 frames in one line in same square size.
             higgins needs idle,talking,moving,shouting(like commander ATTENTION!!!),and also working from desk
             pp need walk front,walk back,walking right/left ,talking,picking up flower and idle. also give me a prompt for a big airplaine the the pp is sit in the back and in the cockpit there is a pilot talking care of the airplane.
             every kid need idle,talking and also freaking out idle and talking 
- [ ] `[P1]` idle that you moved to folder removed from the npc folder 

### Reported
- [ ] `[P0]` write in plan mode!  
- [ ] `[P2]` in pp_sleeping animation  use only the first row 
- [ ] `[P2]` in the top of the screen we can remove to line of click and walk. i want only the cords to stay for now, its important when we need to change the clicks and arrows
- [ ] `[P1]` - in the first screen i need the pp to talk when he said the first sentences.
             - can we change to rooms to be with open door? then i want the pp to make it like he is going out of the door.
             - in the first screen after we click on the top arrow, i want to see the pp walking back and after a second or two to change the screen to the camp
             - in order to talk to lily, we need to get a flower from the lake. change the story as well if needed. first we will try to talk to her, the higgings will arrived and said that she is shy so you need to find another way in order to talk. then in the lake sceen put a flower the we need to get. going back to the camp, from the inventory get out the flower and then we can see the conversation.
- [ ] `[P1]` make sure in the map the landmarks are places in the right place. the map will be always available to open, so what we will do is when the user open the map, each city that he will press(that we not going to fly to), a popup will load with some data on the city.    
- [ ] `[P1]` i want to be able click on each door and get inside, for higgins office lets use the road down right.
- [ ] `[P2]` we made alot of changes in frames. check the code and remove uneeded parts
